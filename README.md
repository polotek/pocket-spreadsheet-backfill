## pocket spreadsheet backfill

This script retrieves archived items from a [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) account and adds them as rows to a google spreadsheet.

## Background

I started on a weekend diversion to make my pocket archive more accessible to people with the help of the @jllord/sheetsee-pocket app. It was pretty simple to get up and running. http://polotek.github.io/sheetsee-pocket/

But the spreadsheet only had 1 item. The one I used to test the integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/). The weekend diversion continues. So I set out to backfill a few of the items from pocket into the spreadsheet to fill out the site. After messing with it for a bit, I wanted to save it, and use it as a practical way to explore some techniques.
